//! Tests for round-trip diagram preservation (grid conversion and rendering).
//!
//! These tests verify that diagrams can be converted to grids and back
//! without losing information (idempotence).

// These are integration-level tests that verify the full pipeline.
// For now, they're placeholder tests that will be filled in during Phase 5.

#[test]
fn test_roundtrip_placeholder() {
    // This test will be implemented when the full pipeline is available
    // Phase 5: Integration will add golden file tests with real diagrams
