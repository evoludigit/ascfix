# LLM Generated: Code Fence Issues
# Copy-paste errors and inconsistent fence lengths

Python example:
```python
def calculate(x, y):
    return x + y
```

But then mismatched:
```javascript
function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}
``

And mix of types:
~~~sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

Code in documentation:
```
This is a code example
with multiple lines
and inconsistent closing
